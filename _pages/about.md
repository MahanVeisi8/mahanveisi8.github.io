As a fourth-year Computer Engineering student at Shahid Beheshti University, Iran, I have cultivated a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Generative Models, and Reinforcement Learning. With a cumulative GPA of 17.97/20 (3.78/4) and graduation expected in January 2026, I am deeply committed to using advanced computational techniques to address real-world challenges, particularly in healthcare and bioinformatics.

My academic journey has been fueled by a drive to bridge theory and practice, where each project presents an opportunity to innovate and solve complex problems. My passion for generative models, especially GANs and diffusion models, extends beyond the classroom; I am currently exploring their applications in 3D modeling and bioinformatics, with aspirations to contribute to advancements in medical imaging and personalized healthcare.

## Research Experience
As a research assistant under [Dr. Armin Salimi-Badr](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=akmKmMQAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate), I have contributed to high-impact projects at the intersection of healthcare and AI, with a focus on transparency and adaptability. One key project involved developing an **explainable AI model** for Parkinson’s Disease detection, achieving 98.7% accuracy through advanced pruning and clustering techniques to enhance model transparency for clinical use. I also collaborated with Dr. Salimi-Badr to create **reinforcement learning models for financial applications**, integrating sentiment analysis to optimize trading strategies. This research was presented at IEEE ICCKE 2024, demonstrating our model’s robustness in financial forecasting.

Currently, I am conducting research in the **Computer Vision Lab at Shahid Beheshti University** under [Prof. Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=trWxrgcAAAAJ&hl=en) and co-advised by [Dr. Shahabedin Nabavi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D_mPA6sAAAAJ&hl=en). My focus is on **MRI reconstruction using cascaded transformers**, developing transformer-based models to handle diverse MRI contrasts and resolutions efficiently. This project aligns with my dedication to advancing medical imaging through deep learning, aiming to produce high-quality diagnostic tools for healthcare.

## Teaching Assistantship
I have served as a teaching assistant for courses including **Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence,** and **Signals and Systems**, where I supported students by managing assignments, teaching supplementary sessions, and guiding project work. These roles allowed me to strengthen my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively and to provide academic support across various aspects of AI and image processing.
