I’m a fourth‑year Computer Engineering undergrad (graduating January 2026) at Shahid Beheshti University, Iran, specializing in generative AI, medical imaging, and computational biology. I am actively seeking <span style="color:red">Master's or PhD</span> opportunities starting in 2026 in these areas.


## Research Experience
Across my research internships and B.Sc. thesis, I’ve contributed to:

- **MRI Reconstruction**  
  Cascaded transformer U‑Nets with Frequency Mining for faster, high‑quality multi‑contrast scans (my B.Sc. thesis); now exploring generative diffusion approaches to push this further.  

- **Computational Biology**  
  Self‑supervised transcriptomic transformers to decode the “language” of cellular systems across imaging and sequencing modalities.  

- **Inverse‑Problem Optimization**  
  Creative diffusion‑based generative models for high‑performance, diverse solutions to real‑world technical challenges.


## Education

- **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering** (Expected Jan 2026)
  Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran
  - Cumulative GPA: **18.10/20 (3.81/4)**
  - Final-year GPA: **19.08/20 (4/4)**  
  - **Relevant Courses (GPA:4/4)**: Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, AI, Data Structures, Signals and Systems, Algorithms



## Languages
- **English**: IELTS 6.5 | S:7, L:7, R:6.5, W:6 (Dec 2024) – retaking in one month to boost my band.  
- **Persian**: Native  
- **Kurdish**: Native


## Teaching Assistantship
I have served as a teaching assistant for courses including **Reinforcement Learning (for MS/PHD students)**, **Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence**, and **Signals and Systems**, where I supported students by managing assignments, teaching supplementary sessions, and guiding project work. These roles allowed me to strengthen my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively and to provide academic support across various aspects of AI and image processing.


## Outside the Lab
Outside of academics, I enjoy running and playing the guitar. Running helps me maintain focus and energy for research, while playing guitar brings a creative balance to my routine. I’m still learning, but you can [check out a recent performance on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4d2jSgseuJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)—don’t judge the beginner’s flair!! I’m improving every day!

I also enjoy playing soccer (both on the field and in FC video games) and am always up for a friendly match. I’ll pick Manchester United—what team will you bring?

## What’s Next?
I’m driven to bridge generative AI and real‑world biology/healthcare. In the short term, I’m refining my MRI and transcriptomics models for top conference submissions; long‑term, I aim to build human‑centered AI systems that enhance diagnostics and accelerate scientific discovery.
