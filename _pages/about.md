I’m a fourth‑year Computer Engineering undergrad (graduating January 2026) at Shahid Beheshti University, Iran, specializing in generative AI, medical imaging, and computational biology. I am actively seeking <span style="color:red">Master's or PhD</span> opportunities starting in 2026 in these areas.

**Research focus:** Generative AI — especially **diffusion models**.

<!-- ## Research Experience
Across my research internships and B.Sc. thesis, I’ve contributed to:

- **MRI Reconstruction**  
  Cascaded transformer U‑Nets with Frequency Mining for faster, high‑quality multi‑contrast scans (my B.Sc. thesis); now exploring generative diffusion approaches to push this further.  

- **Computational Biology**  
  Self‑supervised transcriptomic transformers to decode the “language” of cellular systems across imaging and sequencing modalities.  

- **Inverse‑Problem Optimization**  
  Creative diffusion‑based generative models for high‑performance, diverse solutions to real‑world technical challenges. -->


<!-- ## Education

- **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering** (Expected Jan 2026)
  Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran
  - Cumulative GPA: **18.10/20 (3.81/4)**
  - Final-year GPA: **19.08/20 (4/4)**  
  - **Relevant Courses (GPA:4/4)**: Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, AI, Data Structures, Signals and Systems, Algorithms

## Outside the Lab
Outside of academics, I enjoy running and playing the guitar. Running helps me maintain focus and energy for research, while playing guitar brings a creative balance to my routine. I’m still learning, but you can [check out a recent performance on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4d2jSgseuJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)—don’t judge the beginner’s flair!! I’m improving every day!

I also enjoy playing soccer (both on the field and in FC video games) and am always up for a friendly match. I’ll pick Manchester United—what team will you bring?

<!-- 

## What’s Next?
I’m driven to bridge generative AI and real‑world biology/healthcare. In the short term, I’m refining my MRI and transcriptomics models for top conference submissions; long‑term, I aim to build human‑centered AI systems that enhance diagnostics and accelerate scientific discovery.
