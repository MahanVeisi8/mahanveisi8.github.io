I am a fourth-year B.S. student in Computer Engineering at Shahid Beheshti University, Iran, with a cumulative GPA of 17.97/20 (3.78/4) and an expected graduation in January 2026. My focus is on leveraging Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Generative Models, and Reinforcement Learning to drive innovation in fields like healthcare and bioinformatics.

My academic journey is deeply rooted in hands-on research, where I've tackled complex challenges with applications that bridge theory and practice. Notable projects include developing transformer-based models for **MRI reconstruction** and exploring explainable AI for **Parkinsonâ€™s Disease detection** through advanced pruning and clustering techniques. My work has led to significant achievements, such as co-authoring a study on reinforcement learning for stock trading that was presented at IEEE ICCKE 2024.

## Research Experience
As a research assistant under Dr. Armin Salimi-Badr, I have worked on high-impact projects at the intersection of healthcare and AI. My research includes developing reinforcement learning models for financial applications and designing explainable models for medical diagnostics, with a focus on enhancing accuracy and transparency. I am currently contributing to a project on MRI reconstruction using cascaded transformers, an area that aligns closely with my interest in advancing medical imaging.

## Teaching Assistantship
I have served as a teaching assistant for courses such as Artificial Intelligence and Signals and Systems. In these roles, I managed assignments and provided guidance on project work, including AI applications in image processing. This experience has honed my ability to communicate complex technical concepts effectively and support student learning.
