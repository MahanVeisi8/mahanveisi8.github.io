As a fourth-year Computer Engineering student at Shahid Beheshti University, Iran, I have cultivated a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Generative Models, and Reinforcement Learning. With a cumulative GPA of 17.97/20 (3.78/4) and graduation expected in January 2026, I am deeply committed to using advanced computational techniques to address real-world challenges, particularly in healthcare and bioinformatics.

My academic journey has been fueled by a drive to bridge theory and practice, where each project presents an opportunity to innovate and solve complex problems. My passion for generative models, especially GANs and diffusion models, extends beyond the classroom; I am currently exploring their applications in 3D modeling and bioinformatics, with aspirations to contribute to advancements in medical imaging and personalized healthcare.

## Research Experience
As a research assistant under [Dr. Armin Salimi-Badr](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=akmKmMQAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate), I have worked on impactful projects that lie at the intersection of healthcare and AI, focusing on enhancing transparency, adaptability, and real-world applicability. One of my primary projects involved designing an **explainable AI model** for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease detection, where we achieved 98.7% accuracy by implementing advanced pruning and clustering techniques. This approach not only improved model performance but also emphasized transparency, which is crucial for clinical acceptance. Additionally, I collaborated with Dr. Salimi-Badr to develop **reinforcement learning models for financial applications**, integrating sentiment analysis to optimize trading strategies. This work culminated in a co-authored study presented at IEEE ICCKE 2024, showcasing the adaptability and robustness of our models in financial forecasting.

Currently, I am conducting research in the **Computer Vision Lab at Shahid Beheshti University** under the supervision of [Prof. Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=trWxrgcAAAAJ&hl=en) and co-advised by [Dr. Shahabedin Nabavi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D_mPA6sAAAAJ&hl=en). My focus is on **MRI reconstruction using cascaded transformers**, where I am developing advanced transformer-based models designed to handle various MRI contrasts and resolutions efficiently. This ongoing project aligns closely with my dedication to advancing medical imaging through deep learning techniques, aiming to provide versatile, high-quality diagnostic tools for healthcare applications.


In my research assistant role, I have honed my skills in collaboration, data processing, and model optimization, with a focus on building robust, adaptable solutions for diverse applications.

## Teaching Assistantship
I have served as a teaching assistant for courses including Artificial Intelligence and Signals and Systems, where I supported student learning by managing assignments and guiding project work. My responsibilities involved explaining complex technical concepts and overseeing projects in image processing, experiences that have strengthened my ability to communicate effectively within academic settings.
