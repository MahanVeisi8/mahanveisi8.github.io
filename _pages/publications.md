## Conference and Journal Papers

### Deep Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading  
**M. Veisi**, Sadra Berangi, [Mahdi Shahbazi Khojasteh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QufpdNgAAAAJ&hl=en), [Armin Salimi-Badr](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=akmKmMQAAAAJ&hl=en)  
<span style="float:right;"><em>Accepted for ICCKE 2024</em></span>  
Integrated **FinBERT** for sentiment analysis within a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model to evaluate news sentiment and correlate it with stock price movements. The model achieved a **134.39% cumulative return** with a **1.46 Sharpe ratio**, significantly outperforming benchmarks like DJIA. This work combines natural language processing with reinforcement learning to showcase robust financial trading strategies.

### SincNet for Parkinson’s Disease Detection  
[Armin Salimi-Badr](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=akmKmMQAAAAJ&hl=en), **M. Veisi**, Sadra Berangi  
<span style="float:right;"><em>Under Review for Biomedical Signal Processing Journal</em></span>  
Applied **SincNet layers** to classify Parkinson’s Disease from gait data, achieving **98.7% accuracy**. After training, filters were pruned using K-means clustering and silhouette scores to highlight key frequency bands significant in disease detection. This study enhances explainable AI by identifying critical signal components in Parkinson’s diagnosis.

### All-in-One MRI Reconstruction with Cascaded Transformers  
**M. Veisi**, [Kian Anvari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gHVVhW4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Shahabedin Nabavi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D_mPA6sAAAAJ&hl=en), [Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=trWxrgcAAAAJ&hl=en)  
<span style="float:right;"><em>In Progress</em></span>  
This ongoing project involves developing a cascaded MRI reconstruction model using **prompt-in-prompt learning** and **multi-head transposed cross-attention transformers**. The approach aims to handle various MRI contrasts and resolutions efficiently, leading to an advanced multi-resolution reconstruction pipeline in medical imaging.
